Exceptional Handling : 


to handle runtime errors so that normal flow of application can be maintained




statement1;
statement2;
statement3;     //exception occurs
.....
statement10;


from statement3-statement10  will not execute 


Two Type of Exception : 

1> Checked Exception / Compiletime  : directly inherit throwable class : IOException , SQL, ClassNotFound	
2> Unchecked Exception   / Runtime    : inherits Exception class  : Arithmetic, NullPointer, NumberFormat,ArrayIndexOutOfBound

	try{															
	statement;  //will cause exception
	}catch(Exception)
	{

	EXCEPTIONAL OVERRIDING :
	
	1> superclass method doesnot throw exception
		subclass overriden method cannot declare checked exception,
		but can declare unchecked exception
		
	2> superclass method  throw exception
		subclass overriden method can declare same exception,
		can declare child exception, but not the parent exception
		
		
	parent -> Exception 
	Child -> Exception class/ any unchecked Exception/ any checked Exceptions
	
	Parent -> one unchecked exceptions
	child -> any unchecked exceptions
	
	Parent -> one Checked Exception
	Child -> same checked Exception/ any Unchecked Exceptions
